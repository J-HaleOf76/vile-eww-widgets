# UNSPAGHETTIFICATION

An attempt to unspaghetti the spaghetti.

## TODOS

Todo will be divided into sub-sections as well.

### PREP

Cleanup and sanitize.

- [ ] Cry.
- [ ] Remove all comments and documentations.
- [ ] Scripts should be self-dependant. Do not share functions from `utils.py` for example.
  Knew this was going to bite me in the ass someday.
- [ ] Choose a base colorscheme.
- [ ] Remove redundant screenshots, assets and other junks.
- [ ] Decide if `ewwrc` is needed or, not. Suggest alternatives.
- [ ] Stupid widget naming needs to go. Decide on something descriptive.
- [ ] Scripts should not have extensions.
- [ ] `workspace.zsh` should not be dependant on `zsh` move to `bash/sh` instead.
- [ ] Move `assets` to `src/data`. And, rename `src/shell` to `src/scripts`
- [ ] Start constructing a wiki.

## NOTE

This branch is for preparation and bulk tracking of todos. Each component will have their own
dedicated branch.
